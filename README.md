# shoe-carbon-tracker-
A data science project that analyzes and predicts the carbon footprint of shoes manufacturing procedures using machine learning models. This project aims to provide insights into the environmental impact of the shoe industry and contribute to a more sustainable future.

I would like to special thanks to the authors of "Carbon Footprint of Different Kinds of Footwear â€“ a Comparative Study" for providing the foundation for the dataset used in this project.
