# Carbon Footprint Prediction for Shoes

This repository contains the code and documentation for my project on predicting the carbon footprint of different types of shoes based on their features using a RandomForestRegressor model.

## Project Overview

The project aims to predict the carbon footprint (measured in CO2e) of shoes using features such as shoe type, materials used, and recyclability. The dataset used in this project consists of 200 entries with detailed information about each shoe.

## Data Preprocessing

- Handled categorical data using OneHotEncoder.
- Performed feature scaling and transformation.
- Visualized data distribution using histograms and box plots.

## Model Building

- Used RandomForestRegressor for prediction.
- Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize the model.
- Evaluated model performance with Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score.

## Results

- Achieved an R-squared score of 0.95 and a Mean Squared Error of 0.159.
- Visualized the actual vs predicted carbon footprint values.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/carbon-footprint-prediction.git




A data science project that analyzes and predicts the carbon footprint of shoes manufacturing procedures using machine learning models. This project aims to provide insights into the environmental impact of the shoe industry and contribute to a more sustainable future.

I would like to special thanks to the authors of "Carbon Footprint of Different Kinds of Footwear â€“ a Comparative Study" for providing the foundation for the dataset used in this project.
